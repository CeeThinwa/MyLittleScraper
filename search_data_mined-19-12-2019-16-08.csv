Our mission since day one has been to provide better food to more people.

Our food philosophy of crafting quality products with simple ingredients is what makes Chobani a different kind of yogurt. Our belief that business done right has the ability to change lives and strengthen communities is what makes Chobani a different kind of company.

<div>
Hive is a full stack deep learning platform helping to bring companies into the AI era.</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
Two Stanford graduate students determined to build practical applications using novel deep learning technologies founded <b>Hive </b>(https://thehive.ai/). From the beginning, we knew that high-quality datasets were critical to creating deep learning models. However, we also knew that the quantity of labeled data also has a huge impact on model performance. With this in mind, we first started by building a data- labelling platform specifically designed to solve machine-learning problems. This platform, <b>Hive Data</b>, is now the world’s largest distributed human workforce for data labelling and produces millions of high-quality annotations every day. Hive Data allows us to label uncommonly large datasets at a fraction of the cost that other data labelling solutions would charge. Once Hive Data was built, we were able to quickly label enormous datasets and rapidly build a suite of machine learning models that now form our core offerings in Hive Predict.</div><div>
Our <b>Hive Predict </b>team has since built a wide range of custom machine learning models spanning a range of verticals including media, retail, security, and autonomous driving. Drawing on this experience and expertise, we then set out to build a stand-alone analytics platform for TV advertising called <b>Hive Media</b>. Hive Media synthesises our company's fundamental technologies and leverages industry partnerships to deliver a truly revolutionary product. Hive offers the only true, full- stack deep learning platform in the world, assisting clients with data labelling, model building, and the development of full enterprise solutions.</div><div></div><br/>
<div>
Today, we work with some of the largest companies in the world to redefine how they think about unstructured visual data and together we build solutions that completely transform verticals. We are fortunate to be funded by leading investors like Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), General Catalyst, Formation 8, and others.

<p>
Our ideal Public Relations Press Coordinator is at the start of their career but has aspirations to progress quickly to more senior-level agency positions. Key responsibilities will be tracking the success and result your team generates through media monitoring, fueling our agency’s proprietary results reporting database, creating custom reports to merchandise results to clients, communicating those results directly to clients, and more.</p>
<p>
This role is the perfect opportunity to learn and refine elements of the public relations trade that are the foundation for every role within an agency setting. This includes refining your research skills, developing professional judgment, learning how to strategically communicate with clients and more. You’ll work within the framework of a supportive 3-4 person team that will depend upon and guide you in executing the fundamental account tasks you’ll be leading while valuing your contributions to clients’ campaigns, strategies, events, and activations. We also recognize that the right candidate for this role may not be fresh out of school, but rather a seasoned professional from another field looking to take the first step toward a career pivot, or, a PR veteran who has been away from agency life for a while and looking to reenter.</p>

So what’s Brilliant all about? We are a unique PR agency in that our more than 20 team members each work remotely, with pockets of staff centralized in NYC, LA and Scottsdale, AZ, and even more scattered around the country. We give our people the resources and freedom to get their work done without having to sit in a cubicle or stuffy office, but team members are expected to be self-starting, super-motivated individuals who have project and time management down to an art.
